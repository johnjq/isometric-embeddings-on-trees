This repository is associated with a paper that is under review.
The source code for the different implementations of the proposed algorithm as well as the tree generators will be available once the paper is accepted for publication.

The instances derived from standard benchmarks are not checked into this repository as they are too large.
They are available for download at https://github.com/johnjq/kbs-embeddings-2022/releases/download/benchmark-instances/benchmark-instances.tar.gz.
